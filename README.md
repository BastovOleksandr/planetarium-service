# Planetarium API Service ðŸŒŒ

This Django REST Framework (DRF) powered API facilitates a planetarium service, enabling the management of astronomy shows, themes, and show sessions. It features endpoints for creating and listing show themes and planetarium domes, as well as retrieving and filtering astronomy shows based on titles and themes. Users can reserve tickets for specific show sessions, with built-in pagination for efficient ticket management. The API also includes admin functionalities for uploading show images and managing session details, ensuring a comprehensive and user-friendly experience in the realm of astronomy education and entertainment.
